## Description

"IoT Made Easy!" - Smart Thermostat solution using Zigbee 3.0 and Wi-Fi. The Smart Thermostat enables us to set the temperature using a Thermostat Panel, get the current temperature through Multisensor and switch on/off the air cinditioner based on the current and set temperature and publish the same data onto MQTT through a Zigbee Gateway. This application enables us to create a Smart Termostat.
